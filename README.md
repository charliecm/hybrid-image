By [@charliecm](https://twitter.com/charliecm)

An [hybrid image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_image) creation tool created for an academic course ([IAT455](https://www.sfu.ca/students/calendar/2016/fall/courses/iat/455.html)). It is based on the methods described in the following papers:

- [Hybrid Images](http://cvcl.mit.edu/hybrid/OlivaTorralb_Hybrid_Siggraph06.pdf)
- [Hybrid image using image morphing](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2811547)

This is a __work in progress__.

## Development

Run `npm run watch` to watch files and start a local server at `http://localhost:8080`.

Run `npm run build` to build the project.
